        <h1>FAQs</h1>
        <p>Q: The book I&#160;searched for didn't bring any results on the "search" page. Why?</p>
        <p>A. While the Libby App is constantly growing its catalog of literature, sometimes the</p>
        <p>content isn’t available from your selected library. The Libby App does extend its search</p>
        <p>to nearby libraries when your selected choice doesn’t have the book you’re looking for.</p>
        <p>Unfortunately, that doesn’t always fix the problem. As a result, we are always looking to</p>
        <p>work with more libraries to help ensure the Libby App community find all their</p>
        <p>requested literature.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Q. What are skip-the-line books?</p>
        <p>A. Skip-the-line books are unique pieces of literature found on the Libby App that are noted as special by your selected library.The skip-the-line books will never have</p>
        <p>waitlists and their copies can’t be renewed. Your library may choose to have shorter</p>
        <p>loan periods for them, as well. Additionally, your library may limit the number of skipthe-line books you can borrow, at once. In conclusion, skip-the-line books are a way for</p>
        <p>libraries to provide their members access to popular books, as quickly and efficiently, as</p>
        <p>possible.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Q. What is the difference between the Libby App and Overdrive App?</p>
        <p>A. The Libby and OverDrive Apps both allow for their users to loan content from their local</p>
        <p>libraries. What makes the Libby App unique is the way it is shaped by us to most benefit</p>
        <p>consumers of literature. For instance, the Libby App condenses all your holds from</p>
        <p>nearby libraries into one app. Additionally, the user can use our tags feature to organize</p>
        <p>books in their own way. Your catalog between libraries is seamlessly interconnected and</p>
        <p>you can begin reading immediately after you borrow. We are also very proud of our</p>
        <p>settings and accessibility options that aim to assist the user in an inclusive and friendly</p>
        <p>manner. We believe each of these facets of the Libby App, and more, help make it</p>
        <p>special place for all consumers of literature.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Q. Why can’t I download the Libby App successfully?</p>
        <p>A. The most common issue our users encounter when installing the Libby App is not having</p>
        <p>their device up to date. The Libby App works only on devices iOS 10.0 or later and</p>
        <p>Android devices 5.0 or later. You may need to check your device settings for a</p>
        <p>manufacturer update. Alternatively, your device may need more storage space to install</p>
        <p>the app. On iOS devices the Libby App requires 19.4 MB of storage space while Android</p>
        <p>devices require 3.3 MB</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Q. What if I can’t finish my book by the return date?</p>
        <p>A. The Libby team completely understands that a reader’s plans may change! Because of</p>
        <p>this, the Libby App provides users the ability to extend their loans.</p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <p>Q. How can I get a library card to use the Libby App?</p>
        <p>A. While ever library has its own process to receiving a library card, most of them require</p>
        <p>you to provide contact information before they can send you a personal library card. All</p>
        <p>library cards are free to receive, in The United States of America. Libby also</p>
        <p>interconnects library catalogs near you so that you don’t miss out on any great pieces of</p>
        <p>literature!</p>
