        <h1>Understanding the Different Forms of Literature</h1>
        <p>The Libby App provides access to pieces of literature through various formats. Libby 
shares E-books, audiobooks, magazines, and PDFs. Each format has different functions that allow the Libby user to consume literature. </p>
        <h2>E-books</h2>
        <p>E-books are a part of our most extensive collection of literature throughout the Libby App. E-books can be borrowed and read through the Libby App, but alternative methods are provided to the user. The user can opt to transfer the E-book to their Kindle account, or simply download the E-book in either EPUB, PDF, or Media Do format.</p>
        <h2>Audiobooks</h2>
        <p>Audiobooks provide an alternate consumption method of literature. With the Libby App, users can borrow and listen to audiobooks directly in the Libby App.</p>
        <h2>Magazines</h2>
        <p>Magazines of different types can be borrowed through the Libby App.</p>
