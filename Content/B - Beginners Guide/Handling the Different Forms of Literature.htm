        <h1>Handling the Different Forms of Literature</h1>
        <p>Each piece of literature found in the Libby App is individually borrowed, held, and 
returned. Despite the differences in how they are consumed, they are loaned all the same.</p>
        <h2>Searching</h2>
        <p>Inside the Libby App, select the image of a magnifying glass, that looks like this <img src="../Resources/Images/SearchImage.jpg" style="padding-left: 10px;padding-right: 10px;width: 30px;height: 29px;" />, to bring you to the content search page. In Figure 1, the search feature as well as filters are displayed from the Search page. While you can always use the search bar to find content, filters provide a good alternative when you are not quite sure what literature you wish to consume. For instance, filters can help you refine your search to specific genres, forms, languages, and more. </p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <p>&#160;</p>
        <h2>Borrowing</h2>
        <p>Every Libby account can loan up to 10 different forms of literature. For instance, as a user you can borrow two magazines, four audiobooks, and four e-books, at once. The Libby App will always remind you of the number of loans and holds you have on your account, pictured below.</p>

        </p>
        <p>When you select a piece of content you want to loan, the Libby App requests the duration you wish to borrow for. The Libby App provides the user with the option of a 7-, 14-, or 21-day loan. </p>
        <img src="../Resources/Images/LoanTime.jpg" style="width: 218px;height: 160px;padding-right: 10px;padding-top: 10px;float: left;left: 45px;top: 1033px;" MadCap:mediastyle="@media print { position: absolute;z-index: 0; }" />
        <p> Although, you may request an extension as your loan period comes to an end.</p>
        <p>When the user attempts to borrow a specific form of literature, they may encounter that every copy available on the Libby App, from their library, is checked out. As a result, the user will have the opportunity to place themselves in a queue to hold the book.</p>
        <h2>Returning</h2>
        <p>Returning loaned content is an automatic process that occurs at the end of the</p>
        <p>predetermined loan period. The user can also return their piece of literature early and free up</p>
        <p>one of their hold spots. Lastly, the user can extend their loan period and return the book at a</p>
        <p>later moment</p>
        <h2>Tags</h2>
        <p>Tagging is a feature on the Libby App that allows for the user to categorize their literature pieces. Tagging is as simple as selecting a title of work, choosing the tag option, and creating a name and description for your creation. Tagging is often used to create groups for "Wishlists," "Favorites," "Book Club Reads," and more.</p>
